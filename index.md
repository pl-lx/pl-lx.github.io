PL @ LX is an informal group of people in Lisbon (and surrounding areas) who are interested in programming language design and implementation. Everyone is welcome, from students to industrial developers and academics.

## Mailing List

Most activities are disseminated via the [pl_lx@groups.google.com](https://groups.google.com/g/pl_lx/) mailing list.

## Events

We try to have in-person events to discuss ongoing work. We are also looking for companies interested in hosting our meetups.
