excerpt: Snapshot of the talks hosted at NOVA FCT for PL @ LX Β.
---

At NOVA FCT we focused on semantics, verification, and Rust's future. Two standout sessions:

- **Rodrigo Mesquita (Well-Typed, FCT-UNL)** detailed how semantic linearity can appear in a lazy optimiser in *Type-checking Linearity in Core*.
- **Yoshiki Takashima (CMU)** discussed scaling assurance for safe systems programming in *Testing and Verifying Rust’s Next Mile*.

The follow-up conversations emphasised how academic and industrial perspectives can reinforce each other. We are always looking for new venues—drop us a note if your company can host a future meetup.
