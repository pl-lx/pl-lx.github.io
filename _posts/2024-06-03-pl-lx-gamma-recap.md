PL @ LX Γ brought together speakers from the UK, Germany, Portugal, and beyond. Key takeaways:

- **Philip Wadler (University of Edinburgh)** showed how spotting hand-wavy claims in AI tooling can sharpen our own arguments in *Bullshit Bots*.
- **Peter Thiemann (University of Freiburg)** explored enforcing protocols in *Law and Order for Typestate*.
- **José Fragoso Santos (IST)** demoed tooling for *Detecting and Confirming Injection Vulnerabilities in Node.js Applications*.
- **Vasco T. Vasconcelos (FCUL)** connected semantics and concurrency in *Concurrent programming with the sequential compositions of types*.

Thanks to IST for hosting and to everyone who joined the lively discussions afterwards. Want to help with the next meetup? Check the contact page.
