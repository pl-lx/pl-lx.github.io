# PL @ LX

PL @ LX is an informal group of people in Lisbon (and surrounding areas) who are interested in Programming Language Design and Implementation. Everyone is welcome, from students to industrial developers and academics.


# Mailing-List

Most activities are disseminated via the [pl_lx@groups.google.com mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/pl_lx/).

# Events

We try to have some in-person events to discuss ongoing work. We are also looking for companies interested in hosting our meetups.
