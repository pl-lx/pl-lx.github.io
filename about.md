PL @ LX is an informal group of people in Lisbon (and surrounding areas) who are interested in programming language design and implementation. Everyone is welcome, from students to industrial developers and academics.

We organise discussions, talks, and meetups focused on programming language design, implementation techniques, and related topics.
